      <h1>Introduction</h1><br>
  <p>Brian Eno is a musician and visual artist, widely known for his ambient and experimental music.  Here, we will focus on two of his most pivotal works, <em>Another Green World</em> and <em>Discreet Music</em>.  These to me are considered his two most pivotal since they mark significant change in his style and innovation in the state of music, moving things from the maximalist direction in the early 70s to the minimalist direction in the 80s.  Where <em>Another Green World</em> is more electronically influenced art pop, <em> Discreet Music </em> which came a year later, is ambient.  Both of these albums came after Eno’s tape delay system in 1967, where tape was spooled and unspooled from two adjacent tapes with a time delay that varies each time.  I have hoped to accomplish this with the side by inducing a random delay on the characters that vary each time.  Of course, Eno’s original method was far more analog, consisting of physical processes where this only consists of digital processes.<br>
  As Eno’s career moved forward (his solo career at least, as he was a frequent collaborator with Robert Fripp - King Crimson, David Byrne - Talking Heads, and David Bowie) he released more “furniture music” or music to be listened to in an environment or beside field samples.  Field samples is another experimental technique where one records everyday sounds and environments and releases it as music.  He said of his later ambient music, “it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.”  There is a famous antidote that many claim is the start of Eno’s shift toward ambient music.  That is, in 1975, Eno was in a serious vehicle accident.  He was laying in bed and could not adjust the music that was playing.  As such, the music was barely perceptible and he was forced to listen to it, almost like a forced meditation.  He came to really enjoy it as a new way of experiencing music.  “It is just another part of the ambiance.”  <br></p>

  <h1> Discreet Music </h1><br><p>
  The tape delay mechanism was pivotal in <em>Discreet Music</em>.  Whereas, in software it could be rather trivially implemented, i.e. by using a software random number generator, widespread in programming, to create the delays. These delays, would certainly have entropy or randomness, and would allow for a smaller seed of music to morph into something much larger.  However, in 1975, Eno used an analog tape delay method, similar to its digital counterpart in the end result, but mechanical.  This was pivotal not only for <em> Discreet Music</em> but for the rest of his Ambient collection.  Most notably, <em>Music for Airports</em> which came three years later and had layer after layer of these mechanical tape delays, this time varying in length, and allowing for eternal looping.  Accessible at any attention level.  <em>Discreet Music</em> allows for complex phasing in and out with several of these tape delays.  As the phase shifts escalate upon one another the melodies start to change.  One can try it with this site, just click the figures to begin a melody and the phase shifts will build over time. <br></p>

  <h1> Another Green World </h1><br><p>
  Here is the masterpiece, the album with the minimalist sensibility in the maximalist era of music.  An album influenced as much from Oblique Strategies cards as it was from the field of entropy.  An ambient milestone.  The art on the site is based off of the artwork of <em>Another Green World</em> which was in turn based off of Tom Phillips “After Raphael”.    Both works have received critical acclaim in their respective fields.  With this album Eno had little prepared beforehand, in fact, his only assistance for this solo album was his Oblique Strategies cards.<br>
  Eno experimented with castanet guitars (guitars struck with mallets), the acoustic leslie piano, and other fanciful instruments.  Eno was largely alone for this work and often played the instruments entirely by himself.  The album was heavily instrumental, in fact only five of the tracks on the album have lyrics whatsoever, only about one third of the album.  The lyrics often began as nonsensical syllables that Eno then took and formed into the closest sound phrases.  As such most of the lyrics are meaningless, bizarre, and freely associative.  For many this is undesirable, however, it was good enough to satisfy Pitchfork which gave it a 10.  An award previously reserved for the likes of Kanye, Wilco, Bjork, and 12 Rods.  In fact, the similarities with these four albums are key in themselves.  It’s just up to the listener to discover them.<br></p>

  <h1>Generative Music</h1><p><br>
  To understand generative music, one must have a solid grasp of information theory.  This is the study of how to quantify the amount of information in a medium.  A much related theory is that of entropy which is the amount of uncertainty involved in a process, whereas information can be defined as the resolution of that uncertainty.  Imagine a noisy channel or a lossy encoding.  These transformations will reduce the size of the information by a lot, but the core information by only a little.  This is in contrast to a lossless encoding which reduces the size of information by a lot, without reducing any of the information itself.  Much of coding theory is finding codes for increasing the information over space.  If the size is increased without reducing any uncertainty, this is inherently wasteful.  <br><br>
  Generative music starts with a small seed which is then altered by a stochastic system in order to create music that is eternally changing and morphing.  Multiple versions of music can be created with limited planning.  In Eno’s particular case with Discreet Music he used a tape-delay synthesizer.  Here, Eno supplies a few small melodic samples, both relatively short.  These samples are then overlapped and phased in and out with small stochastic changes in tone.  Contemporary Steve Reich used a field recording in Union Square and stochastically looped it using two tape recordings until the one was 180 degrees out of phase with the other.  He called this phase shifting, to explore the different harmonies when the two recordings are varying.  Process music was spun from there, involving musical structures that evolve over their own duration.  From here several classes of music were build such as chance determination - where the composer creates a stochastic process that describes the music so that there are random elements determining the score out of their hands, or performer process - where those performing the music (as opposed to composing it) are able to make any decisions they would like in interpretation.
